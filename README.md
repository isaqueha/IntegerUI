## Dependencies

### Axios
HTTP client for communicating with the Backend Application.

### Js-cookie
Library for using cookies inside a web application.
Used for storing the API Keys in the application (expiring in 1 day).

### React
All basic React libraries to make a React app.

### React-google-login
Provide the google OAuth button and sign-in handlers.
Needs the `clientId` configured with Google.


## Limitations

### Authorization
The API Keys generated by the service are stored in cookies inside the user session.
For an improved and more secure application, other advanced Authorization and Security approaches should be used. 

### GoogleID OAuth
The usage of the GoogleID OAuth is very simple.
There is room for improvement on how to deal with the GoogleIDs provided tokens.

### HTTP
This service implements simple HTTP.
This can be improved using HTTPS and SSL techniques.
